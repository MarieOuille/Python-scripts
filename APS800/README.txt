# APS800
Python files for APS800

The file "APS800_PhaseAmplitudeVoltage.py" gives FFT amplitude, phase and output voltage as a function of time
-> to do : visualize whether the target stab is active or not

The file "APS800_PhaseOnly.py" plots the CEP vs time with an histogram and the standard deviation value
-> to do : make it work for .dat files containing several sequences (just like in the APS800_PhaseAmplitudeVoltage.py  file)
