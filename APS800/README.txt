# APS800
Python files for APS800

The file "APS800_PhaseAmplitudeVoltage.py" gives everything even if there are multiple measurements within one file
(needs to be checked for more than 2 sequences though)
-> to do : add possibility for a partial plot

The file "APS800_PhaseOnly.py" plots the CEP vs time with an histogram and the standard deviation value
-> to do : make it work for several sequences
