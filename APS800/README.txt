# APS800
Python files for APS800

The file "APS800_PhaseAmplitudeVoltage.py" gives everything even if there are multiple measurements within one file
(needs to be checked for more than 2 sequences though)

The file "APS800_PhaseOnly.py" plots the CEP vs time with an histogram and the standard deviation value
-> to be changed to make it work for several sequences
-> add possibility to plot an interval


-> get basic info in the header
