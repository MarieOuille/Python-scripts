# APS800
Python files for APS800

The file "APS800_PhaseAmplitudeVoltage.py" gives FFT amplitude, phase and output voltage as a function of time
-> to do : add possibility for a partial plot

The file "APS800_PhaseOnly.py" plots the CEP vs time with an histogram and the standard deviation value
-> to do : make it work for .dat files containing several sequences
